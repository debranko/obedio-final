# Crew Management Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the Crew Management system to provide more detailed information about crew members.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Department Field**: Added `department` field to the User model in Prisma schema
  - Type: `String?` (optional)
  - Allows categorizing crew by department (Deck, Engineering, Interior, Galley, Security)

### 2. API Enhancements

#### GET /api/crew
- Now includes `department` field in response
- Added `assignedSmartwatchUid` field showing the UID of any smartwatch assigned to the crew member
- Includes devices relation to fetch assigned smartwatches

#### POST /api/crew
- Now accepts `department` field when creating new crew members
- Made `role` field required (position must be specified)
- Updated validation to ensure role is provided

#### GET /api/crew/[id]
- Enhanced to return `department` and `assignedSmartwatchUid` fields
- Includes devices relation for smartwatch information

### 3. Frontend Updates

#### Crew Page (app/crew/page.tsx)
- Updated `CrewMember` interface to include:
  - `department?: string | null`
  - `assignedSmartwatchUid?: string | null`
- Enhanced crew card display to show:
  - Department information (if available)
  - Assigned smartwatch UID (if available)
- Updated role filter to use position names instead of role codes
- Available positions: Captain, First Officer, Chief Engineer, Chef, Chief Steward, Steward, Deckhand, Engineer, Security Officer

#### Add Crew Modal (components/crew/add-crew-modal.tsx)
- Added department selection dropdown
- Made position (role) field required
- Updated position options to use descriptive names
- Added validation to ensure position is selected

#### Crew Details Drawer (components/crew/crew-details-drawer.tsx)
- Added display of department information
- Added display of assigned smartwatch UID
- Enhanced UI with appropriate icons (Building2 for department, Watch for smartwatch)

### 4. Type Safety Improvements
- Used type assertions to handle TypeScript/Prisma type generation issues
- Maintained runtime correctness while bypassing IDE type checking limitations

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Crew can now be organized by department
2. **Device Tracking**: Easy visibility of which smartwatch is assigned to each crew member
3. **Clearer Roles**: Position names are now more descriptive and user-friendly
4. **Enhanced Filtering**: Can filter crew by specific positions
5. **Improved Data Entry**: Required fields ensure complete crew information

## Testing

A test script (`test-crew-api.js`) has been created to verify:
- Fetching all crew members with new fields
- Creating crew members with department
- Retrieving specific crew member details
- Filtering by role/position

## Future Considerations

1. **Department-based Filtering**: Add department filter to the crew page
2. **Smartwatch Assignment**: Create UI for assigning/unassigning smartwatches
3. **Department Statistics**: Show crew count by department
4. **Role Permissions**: Different permissions based on position/department
5. **Shift Patterns**: Department-specific shift patterns

## Migration Notes

- Existing crew members will have `null` department values
- The system is backward compatible - department is optional
- Smartwatch assignment uses existing device relationships
