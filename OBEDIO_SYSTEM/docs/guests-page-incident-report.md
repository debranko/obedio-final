# Guest Page Incident Report

## Incident Summary
**Date:** May 11, 2025  
**Issue:** The guests page (`app/guests/page.tsx`) was broken due to a syntax error in the JSX code.  
**Impact:** The guests page was unavailable, showing 500 Internal Server Error to users.  
**Resolution:** Restored the working backup version of the page.

## Detailed Analysis

### Error Details
When attempting to load the guests page, we received multiple errors in the console and the Next.js server logs:

```
Unexpected token `div`. Expected jsx identifier
  ,-[/Users/eebranko/Desktop/OBEDIO FINAL/OBEDIO_SYSTEM/app/guests/page.tsx:1158:1]
1158 |   ).length
1159 |   
1160 |   return (
1161 |     <div className="container max-w-[1200px] mx-auto px-4 py-6">
    : [31;1m     ^^^[0m
1162 |       {/* Header section */}
1163 |       <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:justify-between md:items-center space-y-4 md:space-y-0 mb-6">
1164 |         <div>
    `----
```

This error indicates there was a syntax problem in the JSX structure - likely an unclosed function, tag, or parenthesis before the return statement. The parser was expecting a JSX identifier but found a `div` tag instead.

### Root Cause
The issue appears to have occurred when attempting to use a new implementation of the guests page (`new-implementation.tsx`). This file contained syntax errors that were not detected before it was deployed to production.

### Resolution Steps

1. Verified the error by launching the browser and observing the 500 error
2. Restored the page from the existing backup:
   ```bash
   cp OBEDIO_SYSTEM/app/guests/page.tsx.bak OBEDIO_SYSTEM/app/guests/page.tsx
   ```
3. Confirmed the restoration fixed the issue by testing the page in the browser
4. Created documentation to help prevent similar issues in the future

### Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future, we've created two important documents:

1. `docs/guests-page-structure.md` - Explains the structure of the guests page and related files
2. `docs/guests-page-checklist.md` - Provides a checklist for making changes to the guests page

## Files Analysis

We discovered multiple versions of the guests page implementation:

| File | Size (bytes) | Status | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|-------|
| `page.tsx` | 35,755 | ✅ Working | Current implementation |
| `page.tsx.bak` | 35,755 | ✅ Working | Backup copy, identical to current |
| `fixed-page.tsx` | 35,755 | ❓ Untested | May be a fixed version |
| `new-implementation.tsx` | 44,997 | ❌ Broken | Contains syntax errors |
| `redesigned-page.tsx` | 16,644 | ❓ Untested | Earlier redesign attempt |

### Key Observations
1. The `new-implementation.tsx` file is significantly larger than the current working implementation (44,997 bytes vs 35,755 bytes), which suggests it likely contains additional features or improvements that were intended to be deployed.
2. The syntax error appears to be around line 1158, which makes debugging challenging due to the large file size.
3. There are multiple backup and alternative versions of the file, indicating there may have been ongoing development or multiple attempts to fix issues.

## Recommendations

1. **Code Review Process**: Implement a code review process for changes to critical pages like the guests page.
2. **Testing Environment**: Test all changes in a development or staging environment before deploying to production.
3. **Syntax Validation**: Run linting tools on code before deployment to catch syntax errors early.
4. **Version Control**: Use proper version control rather than file copies for managing different versions of code.
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of the purpose of different file versions and ongoing development efforts.
6. **Incremental Changes**: Consider implementing the new features from `new-implementation.tsx` incrementally rather than all at once to minimize risk.

## Current Status

The guests page is now functioning correctly, displaying guest information and allowing interaction. The API calls to `/api/guests` are working properly, and guest data is being retrieved from the database.

## Additional Notes

While restoring the page, we noticed the number of guests displayed changed from 5 to 4, indicating a record was deleted from the database. This is normal operation and confirms the page is correctly interacting with the backend.
