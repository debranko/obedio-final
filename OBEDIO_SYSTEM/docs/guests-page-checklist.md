# Guests Page Modification Checklist

## Before Making Changes

- [ ] Verify the current implementation works correctly
- [ ] Create a backup of the working file (example: `cp page.tsx page.tsx.pre-changes`)
- [ ] Document the purpose of your changes
- [ ] Review related components that might be affected

## File Analysis Before Modifications

This project contains multiple versions of the guests page implementation:
| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `page.tsx` | Current working implementation | ✅ Working |
| `fixed-page.tsx` | Fixed version from May 10 | ❓ Untested directly |
| `new-implementation.tsx` | Enhanced version from May 10 | ❌ Contains syntax errors |
| `redesigned-page.tsx` | Earlier redesign | ❓ Untested |

**Important Note:** The `new-implementation.tsx` file is larger (44,997 bytes vs 35,755 bytes for the current working version) and likely contains additional features, but has syntax errors around line 1158 that prevent it from compiling properly.

## When Making Changes

- [ ] Make incremental changes rather than wholesale replacements
- [ ] Test each significant change by running the dev server
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify API calls are working correctly
- [ ] Test guest selection and detail panel functionality

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **JSX Syntax Errors**: Ensure all tags are properly closed and all functions have proper return statements
2. **API Integration**: Verify API calls to `/api/guests` return properly formatted data
3. **Component Dependencies**: Check for changes to imported components like `guest-detail-panel.tsx`
4. **CSS/Layout Issues**: Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsive design works

## Recovery Plan

If issues occur after changes:

1. Restore from backup:
   ```bash
   cp page.tsx.bak page.tsx
   ```

2. Check server logs for specific errors

3. If using a new implementation from one of the other files, carefully review it for syntax errors before deployment

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Consider merging the best features from `new-implementation.tsx` after fixing its syntax errors
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for guest data structures
- Implement better error handling for API failures
- Add unit tests for critical guest page functionality
